# Yield Aggregator Smart Contract

A sophisticated yield optimization protocol built on Stacks blockchain that automatically allocates deposited tokens across multiple DeFi strategies to maximize returns while managing risk.

## Features

- **Automated Yield Optimization**: Dynamically allocates funds to the highest-yielding strategies
- **Multi-Strategy Support**: Supports up to 10 concurrent yield-generating strategies
- **SIP-010 Compliant**: Fully implements the SIP-010 fungible token standard
- **Risk Management**: Built-in risk scoring system and emergency shutdown mechanism
- **Fee Structure**: Configurable performance and management fees
- **User Shares**: Proportional share token system for tracking user deposits

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Strategy Management**

   - Dynamic strategy registration
   - APY tracking and updates
   - Risk scoring system
   - TVL monitoring
   - Strategy allocation limits

2. **User Management**

   - Deposit tracking
   - Share token calculation
   - Withdrawal processing
   - Balance management

3. **Security Features**
   - Emergency shutdown
   - Access controls
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Slippage checks

### Key Data Structures

- `Strategies`: Stores strategy information and performance metrics
- `UserDeposits`: Tracks user deposits and share tokens
- `StrategyAllocations`: Manages strategy allocation parameters

## Usage

### For Users

```clarity
;; Deposit tokens
(contract-call? .yield-aggregator deposit token-trait amount)

;; Withdraw tokens
(contract-call? .yield-aggregator withdraw token-trait share-amount)

;; Query user info
(contract-call? .yield-aggregator get-user-info user-principal)
```

### For Administrators

```clarity
;; Add new strategy
(contract-call? .yield-aggregator add-strategy name protocol min-deposit max-deposit)

;; Update strategy APY
(contract-call? .yield-aggregator update-strategy-apy strategy-id new-apy)

;; Toggle emergency shutdown
(contract-call? .yield-aggregator toggle-emergency-shutdown)
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Description                |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| u100 | Not authorized             |
| u101 | Invalid amount             |
| u102 | Insufficient balance       |
| u103 | Strategy already exists    |
| u104 | Strategy not found         |
| u105 | Strategy disabled          |
| u106 | Maximum strategies reached |
| u107 | Slippage too high          |
| u108 | Emergency shutdown active  |

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**

   - Contract owner privileges
   - Strategy management restrictions
   - Emergency shutdown capability

2. **Fund Safety**

   - Deposit/withdrawal validations
   - Balance checks
   - Share token calculations

3. **Risk Management**
   - Strategy risk scoring
   - Allocation limits
   - Emergency procedures

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage is essential. Test cases should include:

1. Basic functionality

   - Deposits
   - Withdrawals
   - Share calculations

2. Strategy management

   - Adding strategies
   - Updating APY
   - Allocation logic

3. Security features

   - Access controls
   - Emergency shutdown
   - Error conditions

4. Edge cases
   - Zero amounts
   - Maximum values
   - Invalid inputs
